## 💬 Chatbot Integration

Students can interact with an AI-powered chatbot to get deeper insights into their recommendations.  
Example queries:
- _"Why was Machine Learning recommended for me?"_
- _"How does this course fit into my long-term career plan?"_

The chatbot responds **contextually**, leveraging:
- Previously recommended courses  
- Student profile data (skills, goals, preferences)  
- Live course database (MongoDB)  
- Real-time LLM inference via **Gemma:2B** using **Ollama**

Supports both **instant** and **streamed** responses for a natural conversational flow.
